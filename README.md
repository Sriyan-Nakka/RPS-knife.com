# Rock, Paper, Scissors, Knife

This is a game that I experienced in a dream. This game kinda reminds me of Squid Game Season 2 Rock, Paper, Scissors, Minus One game, but they are totally different, but a similarity is they both are rock paper scissor game but modified.

The game rules are simple, you must set a goal with the minimum being 3, and it is regular rock paper scissors, but the catch is there is a knife. When a person picks the knife, you must think of a number between 1 and 2(in this web version the bot will select a random number between 1 and 2), and the other opponent must guess it, if they have guessed wrong, they are killed(hence the knife) and the other person wins. But, if they guess the number correctly, They are not killed and the game continues as usual without any increase of points for both of them.

These were definitely not the rules in my dream but these rules feel a bit fair and balanced so I did. The knife can be used as a way to kill the opponent who has more points than him and catching up to them can be difficult. But you should not just kill your opponent right away, it is supposed to used a tool at times in need, as it is a 50/50 chance, anything can happen. Also, the background for this website was made by ChatGPT(it is said in the footer of the website too). Hope you enjoy my game!ðŸ˜„
